🎶 Music Fame vs. Talent : A Data-Driven Analysis of Spotify Trends
The Question I Explored:
Does an artist's fame in form of follower count guarantee a hit song? And which music genres are dominating popularity charts right now?
My Findings and my Aha Moment:
I analyzed a large Spotify dataset to find my insights:
Weak Correlation: The overall Followers-to-Popularity Correlation is only 0.23 as seen in the chart. This reveals a very weak link! A song's quality and market trend are far more important than just the artist's follower count.
Genre Power: Genres like K-pop, EDM, and Rap consistently show the highest median popularity scores around 60-75 points out of 100, making them the safest bets for a hit in today's market.
